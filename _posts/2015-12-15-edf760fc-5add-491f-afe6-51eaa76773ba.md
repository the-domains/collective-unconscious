How to play _The Consent Game_

The consent game requires three people, to 'players' and one person to direct. It's such a simple concept but the results are really interesting and what emerges, as you can see from the images, is intimate and sensual interactions between the two players. 

The crux of this piece is, as the title suggests, consent. It's essential that both participants at every stage of the game are asked to give their consent before undertaking any action. The key here is to build trust between the players before asking them to do anything particularly challenging. Even then, as the director, don't be disappointed if your requests are rejected. That's really the point of the piece. To facilitate an exploration where both players are happy and willing to engage. The game ends when one participant does not consent to undertake the action. There is no winner or loser. The exploration has finished. 

What you need: 

1\. Three people.

2\. Blindfolds for the players. 

3\. A private space. It helps if it's dimly lit and relaxing. When we're performing this we have _Roads _by Portishead on a loop but you can choose whatever song you think fits.  

How to play: 

1\. The players kneel in front of one another. 

2\. The director asks the players if they consent to be blindfolded. Once this has been confirmed they blindfold the players.

3\. The director then issues a series of requests to the players and asks if they consent. A good initial request might be something like - 'Mark, I want you to place your left hand on La's shoulder. Do you both consent?'

4\. One thing that we were aiming for is a sense of symmetry and visual beauty. So, for example, the above request would be repeated with the other player so both you have their left hands on the other's shoulders. 

5\. Gradually as trust builds between the players and the director and they become familiar with the game, the director can issue more challenging requests. 'La, I'd like you to remove Mark's top. Do you both consent?' Basically as the director, your role is to see how far you can push things before one or both the players remove their consent.   

That's it! It's really simple but the results are fairly profound. Have fun playing this at parties. It's a fantastic ice-breaker and people won't forget it in a hurry.
