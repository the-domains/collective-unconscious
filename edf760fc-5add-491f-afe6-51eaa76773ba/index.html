<p>3. The director then issues a series of requests to the players and asks if they consent. A good initial request might be something like - 'Mark, I want you to place your left hand on La's shoulder. Do you both consent?'</p><p>4. One thing that we were aiming for is a sense of symmetry and visual beauty. So, for example, the above request would be repeated with the other player so both you have their left hands on the other's shoulders. </p><p>5. Gradually as trust builds between the players and the director and they become familiar with the game, the director can issue more challenging requests. 'La, I'd like you to remove Mark's top. Do you both consent?' Basically as the director, your role is to see how far you can push things before one or both the players remove their consent.   </p><p>That's it! It's really simple but the results are fairly profound. Have fun playing this at parties. It's a fantastic ice-breaker and people won't forget it in a hurry.    </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="29"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="30">How to play The Consent Game</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
